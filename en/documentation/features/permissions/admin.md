#Manage permissions for administrators

Thelia 2 permissions system is based on ***administration profiles*** which can be assign to the ***administrators***.

##What is an ***administration profile***

An ***administration profile*** determines for all Thelia 2 back-office resources and modules if *view*, *create*, *update* and *delete* permissions are granted or not.

You can view, create, update and delete administration profiles - if you have the permissions of course - in **Configuration > Administration profiles** back-office menu.
